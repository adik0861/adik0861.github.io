Hi there and welcome to my data science Github page.  The purpose of this is two-fold:
1. to act as a showcase for some of the projects I created over the course of my graduate career at UCR, and
2. to (hopefully) contribute back--I can't even begin to count the number of times the answer to some obscure DS question was found buried in a GitHub page from the Paleolithic era (or about 2 months ago in the ML field).
