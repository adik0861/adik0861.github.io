Hi there and welcome to my data science Github page.  The purpose of this is two-fold:
1. to act as a showcase for some of the projects I created over the course of my graduate career at UCR, and
2. to (hopefully) contribute back--I can't even begin to count the number of times the answer to some obscure DS question was found buried in a GitHub page from the Paleolithic era (or about 2 months ago in the ML field).

Though do note that this site is still heavily under construction as I try to actually explain in detail the inner trappings of my various programs.  I'm currently working on ~~finishing up~~ the [page on this sweet MapReduce code](/project1/) I put together (to calculate TF-iDF scores for some 11 million Tweet dataset).  The page for my ConvNet projects will likely take even longer to wrap up.
