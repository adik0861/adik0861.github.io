Welcome to my data science Github page.  I hope to use this site to showcase some of the projects I created over the course of my graduate career at UCR, and to (hopefully) contribute back--I can't even begin to count the number of times the answer to some obscure DS question was found buried in a GitHub page from the Paleolithic era (or about 2 months ago in the ML field). Though do note that this site is still heavily under construction as I try to actually explain in detail the inner trappings of my various programs.  I'm currently finishing up the [page on this sweet MapReduce code](/project1/) I put together (to calculate TF-iDF scores for some 11 million Tweet dataset).  The page for my ConvNet projects will likely take even longer to wrap up.
