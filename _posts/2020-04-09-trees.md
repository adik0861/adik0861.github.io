We'll begin by only considering **undirected graphs**, or graphs in which edges don't possess any corresponding information about direction (see [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) as an example of directed graphs), so basically edges are nothing more than unordered pairs of vertices.  A more formal definition is given below (thanks to [nist.gov](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/undirectedGraph.html) of all places):

$\newcommand{\para}[1]{\left(#1\,\right)}$
$\newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left|#1\,\right|}$

#### Undirected graphs
A graph $G$ is a pair $\para{V,E}$, where $V$ is a set of vertices, and $E$ is a set of edges between the vertices $E \subseteq \para{u,v \mid u, v \in V}$. If the graph does not allow self-loops, adjacency is irreflexive, that is $E \subseteq \para{u,v \mid u, v \in V \wedge u \ne v}$.

Note that this latter definition is the one we'll actually be using as a simply undirected graph will have no loops or duplicate edges.

## Terminology
* Root is the topmost node of the tree
* Edge is the link between two nodes
* Child is a node that has a parent node
* Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node
* Leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
* Height is the length of the longest path to a leaf
* Depth is the length of the path to its root


#### Handshaking lemma
The count of edges connecting to a vertex is known as the degree of vertex or $\text{deg}\para{v}$ (also known as _valency_).  The **handshake lemma** states that the sum of all degrees of vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.

\begin{equation}
\sum_{v\in V}\text{deg}(v)=2\abs{E}
\end{equation}
